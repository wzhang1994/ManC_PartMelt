# Mantle Composition After Partial Melting 

ManC_PartMelt (**Man**tle **C**omposition After **Part**ial **Melt**ing) is for calculating the chemical composition (major oxides) of residues (solid) and melt (liquid) phases after partial melting in the upper mantle.

The code estimates the degree of partial melting of the mantle with various crustal thicknesses by applying the theoretical mid-oceanic ridge (MOR) model from Afonso et al., (2008). They referred to the melting model of MOR from Klein and Langmuir (1987) and proposed a nonlinear empirical relationship between the degree of partial melting of mantle and the pressure (or depth). 

After estimating the mean degree of partial melting, this code uses empirical partition coefficients from Niu (1997) for calculating the chemical composition of residues (solid) and melt (liquid) phases.
